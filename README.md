# bighealth
A modular Python command-line tool for interacting with the F5 iHealth API. BigHealth allows you to automate the download and organization of diagnostic data, configuration files, logs, and other information from your F5 BIG-IP QKViews. Eventually, being able to identify common misconfigurations and prtential problems is the goal.
